# Madrid Pollution Analysis

The work consists in analyzing a big dataset with *hourly pollution* data from **Madrid**, in the period **2011 to 2016.     

So there are four parts in which this project can be divided in (besides from the report):     

1. **Reading** every piece of raw data and creating the whole initial raw_data set.       
2. **Processing** raw_data to create a daily dataset, by averaging each hourly measure, and containing also the weather variables and the names for each pollutant parameter.        
3. Generating a **descriptive analysis** with correlation matrices, scatterplots, time series charts ...     
4. Creating a **linear regression model** that explains *NO2.
